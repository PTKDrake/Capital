      '#import-from': |-
        Accounts from the specified sources will be converted to this account type.

        Enabling this option does NOT import the database from other databases.
        Please use the migration tool to import the database first,
        then enable this option to start importing accounts for new players.

        This option does NOT affect players who already have an account of this type.

        Possible values: ~ (do not import), economyapi
      import-from: economyapi
  '#term': |-
    The name of the command argument for the currency.
    Also used in forms when to select the currency.
  term: currency
  '#default-currency': |-
    The default currency to use in commands if the user does not specify one.
    If this is set to ~, the user is required to specify the currency for every command.
    This option can be overridden in the config for individual commands.

'#': |-
  This is the main config file of Capital.
  You can change the values in this file to configure Capital.
  If you change some main settings that change the structure (e.g. schema), Capital will try its best
  to migrate your previous settings to the new structure and overwrite this file.
  The previous file will be stored in config.yml.old.
'#analytics': Settings related to statistics display.
analytics:
  '#player-infos': |-
    The InfoAPI infos for a player.
    An info is a number related to the wealth or activities of a player,

    '#money': This is an example info that displays the total money of a player.
    money:
      '#of': |-
        The data source of this info.
        If set to "account", the info is calculated from statistics of some of the player's accounts.
        If set to "transaction", the info is calculated from statistics of the player's recent transactions.
      of: account
      '#selector': Selects which accounts of the player to calculate.

      metric: balance-sum
      '#update-freuqency': |-
        The frequency in seconds at which the info is refreshed from the server.
        This will only affect displays and will not affect transactions.
      update-freuqency: 5
  '#info-commands': |-
    Commands that display information about a player.
    You can use the infos defined in the player-infos section above,
    as well as usual InfoAPI commands.

      using the {money} info defined above.

      self-requires-op: false
      '#other-requires-op': |-
        If set to true, only ops can use this command for other
        (you can further configure this with permission plugins).
      other-requires-op: true
      '#format': |-
        The format of command output.
        Use InfoAPI syntax here.
      format: '{name} has ${money}.'
  '#top-player-commands': |-
    A top-player command lets you create commands that discover the top players in a certain category.
    It provides the answer to questions like "who is the richest player?" or
    "who spent the most money last week?".
  top-player-commands:
    '#richest': This is an example top-player command that shows the richest players.
    richest:
      '#command': The command that displays the information.
      command:
        '#description': The description message of this command.
        description: Displays the richest player
        '#requires-op': |-
          If set to true, only ops can use this command
          (you can further configure this with permission plugins).
        requires-op: false
      '#selector': Selects which accounts of each player to calculate.
      selector:
        '#currency': The currency to use.

        The statistic used to combine multiple values.

        Possible values:
        - "account-count": The number of accounts selected.
        - "balance-sum": The sum of the balances of the accounts selected.
        - "balance-mean": The average balance of the accounts selected.

        - "balance-min": The minimum balance of the accounts selected.
        - "balance-max": The maximum balance of the accounts selected.
      metric: balance-sum
      '#refresh': |-
        Refresh settings for the top query.
        These settings depend on how many active accounts you have in the database
        as well as how powerful the CPU of your database server is.
        Try increasing the frequencies and reducing batch size if the database server is lagging.
      refresh:
        '#batch-size': |-
          Number of players to recompute at once.
          Data are only recomputed if they are older than recompute-frequency.
          Try reducing this value if the database server is having lag spikes.
        batch-size: 200
        '#batch-frequency': |-
          The number of seconds between batches.

          If there are multiple servers connected to the same database,
          the batch frequency is scheduled independently on each server,
          but the CPU and memory consumed are still on the database server.
          You may want to multiply this frequency by the number of servers.
        batch-frequency: 10
        '#recompute-frequency': |-
          The number of seconds for which metrics are considered valid and will not be recomputed.

          Originally, the metrics of a player are recomputed every (batch-frequency * number-of-active-accounts / batch-size) seconds.
          This wastes CPU and memory on the database server if there are too few active accounts.
          Setting a higher recompute-frequency reduces the frequency of recomputation and saves electricity,
          but the top list results may be more outdated.
          Note that recompute-frequency does nothing if it is lower than (batch-frequency * number-of-active-accounts / batch-size).
        recompute-frequency: 86400
      '#pagination': Pagination settings for the top query.
      pagination:
        '#per-page': Number of top players to display per page
        per-page: 5
        '#limit': Total number of top players to display through this command.
        limit: 5
      '#messages': Configures the displayed messages
      messages:

        header: Showing page {page} of {totalPages}
        '#entry': This line is repeated for each entry in the page.
        entry: '#{rank} {name}: {value}'
        '#footer': The bottom line of the page.
        footer: ""
